# Decision-tree-algorithm with titanic dataset.

The decision tree Algorithm belongs to the family of supervised machine learning algorithms. It can be used for both a classification problem as well as for regression problem.

The goal of this algorithm is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable, for which the decision tree uses the tree representation to solve the problem in which the leaf node corresponds to a class label and attributes are represented on the internal node of the tree.
